# TryHackMe: Summit Room â€“ Detection Engineering & Purple Team Project

This repository documents my practical hands-on work from the [Summit room on TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/summit?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=social_share&utm_content=room). This lab simulates real-world adversary behavior and challenges you to detect and block malicious actions using defensive tools and strategies.

## âœ… Completion

## Skills Gained

- Malware sandbox analysis
- Defense building using the **Pyramid of Pain** framework
- Hash-based detection and mitigation
- Firewall and DNS-based blocking
- Writing Sigma rules for:
  - Registry changes
  - Network anomalies
  - File creation events
- Detection of MITRE ATT&CK TTPs
- Practical blue-team defense escalation techniques
