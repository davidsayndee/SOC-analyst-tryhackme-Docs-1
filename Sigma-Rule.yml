## Summary

The Summit module challenged me to think like both an attacker and defender by escalating my detection strategies from simple hash blocking to advanced behavior-based rules. This experience sharpened my blue-team capabilities and detection engineering mindset.

I am confident working with:
- Sysmon logs
- Sigma rule creation
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Firewall & DNS configurations

> Iâ€™m continuing to grow as a Blue Team professional and Detection Engineer. Letâ€™s connect!
