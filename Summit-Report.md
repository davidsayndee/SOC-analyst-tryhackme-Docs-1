# TryHackMe: Summit – SOC Analyst Project Documentation

## Module Name:
**TryHackMe – Summit**

## Hands-On Skills Learned:
- Investigated a simulated cyber attack using real-world artifacts
- Analyzed logs (browser history, PowerShell, email metadata)
- Used the MITRE ATT&CK® Framework to map adversary behaviors
- Identified key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Practiced report writing and incident analysis

## What This Module Taught Me:
This room taught me how to:
- Piece together a phishing attack timeline
- Trace attacker movement through system logs
- Detect persistence and privilege escalation
- Think critically and write solid incident reports

## Why This Is Important for a SOC Analyst:
- Detecting phishing and credential theft is crucial in real SOC work
- Understanding attacker behavior helps reduce dwell time
- Applying MITRE ATT&CK improves threat hunting and detection rules
- Strong documentation guides faster remediation and response
